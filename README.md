## Redis Learning Project

This repository is a record of my journey learning Redis. It serves as a place to document concepts, code examples, and resources to solidify my understanding. 

### Getting Started

This project isn't intended to be a single script; instead, it's a collection of folders and files exploring various Redis functionalities. Feel free to browse the content and experiment with the code examples.

### Content

The repository is structured into several folders, each focusing on a specific aspect of Redis:

* **fundamentals:** This folder covers the core building blocks of Redis, including data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes), sorted sets, hyperlogs, and the Pub/Sub messaging model.
* **operations:** Here, you'll find explorations of functionalities like bulk data insertion using various commands and delve into Redis database design principles.
* **protocol:** This section explains interacting with Redis through its protocol (RESP). 
* **administration:**  This section covers Redis management tools, client interaction (e.g., redis-cli,client libraries), and explores Redis persistence options.
* **advanced:** Here, you'll find deeper dives into topics like Redis replication, clusters, Lua scripting for server-side execution, RediSearch for full-text search capabilities, RedisBloom for creating space-efficient filters, and RedisJSON for working with JSON data structures within Redis.

Within each folder, you'll find markdown files (`.md`) containing explanations, code snippets, and additional resources.

### Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal learning, feel free to explore the content and raise any questions through pull requests or discussions. If you have improvements or additional topics you'd like to see covered, consider contributing!
