## Redis Learning Project

This repository is a record of my journey learning Redis. It serves as a place to document concepts, code examples, and resources to solidify my understanding. 

### Getting Started

This project isn't intended to be a single script; instead, it's a collection of folders and files exploring various Redis functionalities. Feel free to browse the content and experiment with the code examples.

### Content

The repository is structured into several folders, each focusing on a specific aspect of Redis:
* **Introduction:** The Introduction folder covers Redis basics: what it is, what it does, it supports.
* **fundamentals:** This folder covers the core building blocks of Redis, including data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes), sorted sets, hyperlogs, and the Pub/Sub messaging model.
* **operations:** Here, you'll find explorations of functionalities like bulk data insertion using various commands and delve into Redis database design principles.
* **protocol:** This section explains interacting with Redis through its protocol (RESP). 
* **administration:**  This section covers Redis management tools, client interaction (e.g., redis-cli,client libraries), and explores Redis persistence options.
* **advanced:** Here, you'll find deeper dives into topics like Redis replication, clusters, Lua scripting for server-side execution, RediSearch for full-text search capabilities, RedisBloom for creating space-efficient filters, and RedisJSON for working with JSON data structures within Redis.
* **Example** variety of examples
* **NOTE.md** If necessary, I will write important points in this file

Within each folder, you'll find markdown files (`.md`) containing explanations, code snippets, and additional resources.
